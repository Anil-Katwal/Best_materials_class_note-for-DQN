CNN- image multimedia
RNN- Acc. Training 
ANN- for approximation 
Filter (kernel)
In charge to decide ti feature
Filter size is the hyper parameter..
(Filter size should not be small).
Number of the convulation layer is also hyper parameter,

Pooling :
To reduce the dimensionality
Eliminates nouse fron data
. Flatten and dense:
Flattening convert n dimension into a readable vector(tensor flow)
Converting from higher dimensions image to 1 dimensions is called accelerating.
GPU Architecture:
Streaming Multiprocessor(SM)
CUDA cores per SM.
